## Facial Expression Recognition

This project is a facial expression recognition system that uses a convolutional neural network to classify facial expressions. The dataset used to train the model is the FER2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 grayscale images of faces with 48x48 pixels. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with 28,709 and 3,589 images, respectively. The model is trained using the training set and evaluated using the testing set. The model achieves an accuracy of 63.5% on the testing set.
